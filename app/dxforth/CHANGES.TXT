                          IMPORTANT CHANGES

This document discusses changes to DX-Forth for DOS that may adversely
affect previously written programs.  It is recommended users update their
programs to the latest DX-Forth version.  See WHATSNEW.TXT for a summary
of other changes and additions.


v4.45

   READ-LINE status changed from true|false result to a ternary value
   (-1|0|1).  See DXFORTH.GLO for details.

   ." is now state-smart allowing it to be used in interpret mode.
   .( is deprecated and moved to TOOLS for backward compatibility.
   Applications supplied in the DX-Forth distribution have been updated
   to reflect the change.

   DOSLIB changes:

     C/STRING moved to kernel.  (D.R) (U.R) is removed as applications
     can use new string function (S.R), or define:

     : (D.R) ( d w -- a u )  >R (D.) R> (S.R) ;
     : (U.R) ( u w -- a u )  0 SWAP (D.R) ;

v4.44

   DOSLIB changes:

     Renamed /INBUF /OUTBUF to #INBUF #OUTBUF

v4.43

   .NAME is deleted.  The direct equivalent is: >NAME .ID

   Removed embedded string '(y/n)' from Y/N.

   /NUMBER introduced in 4.42 is replaced with a new function.  Previous
   usage should be replaced with:  0 0 2SWAP >NUMBER

   >FLOAT reverts back to Forth-94 specification in respect of string
   of blanks and empty string (see 4.42 below).

   DOSLIB changes:

     FINDALL now requires the attribute (usually 0) be provided as an
     argument.

     Renamed QSORT FREPOS REPOSINFILE REPOSOUTFILE INFILEPOS OUTFILEPOS
     to SORT FSEEK SEEKINFILE SEEKOUTFILE POSINFILE POSOUTFILE
     respectively.

     /INTEGER /RAWNUM are deleted.  Kernel /NUMBER replaces /INTEGER.
     /RAWNUM may be replaced by /NUMBER DROP.

     >FID returns -1 to indicate handle closed (previously 0).

v4.42

   ALLOT and RESERVE no longer perform an ERASE.  This permits data of
   arbitrary length to be loaded at HERE and then ALLOTed.  See /ALLOT
   /RESERVE in MISC.SCR for versions that erase.

   Forth-94 recommendation that >FLOAT returns 0.0E and true for a
   string of blanks is no longer supported.  A zero length string now
   returns false.  See >FLOAT in glossary.

   The fig-FORTH convention of making vocabularies IMMEDIATE has been
   adopted.  Consequently FORTH ASSEMBLER HIDDEN EDITOR are now
   immediate.

   UPPER now assumes the SSEG segment for increased flexibility.

v4.41

   Console input has been changed to allow 8 bit character sets (see KEY
   in glossary).  Consequently the PC extended key codes now start at
   256 instead of 128.  See DXFORTH.TXT for a listing of the new codes.

   Character propagation in CMOVE & CMOVE> is no longer supported.  To
   fill a region with a specified character use FILL.

v4.40

   CSP changed from double cell variable back to a single.  Files in the
   distribution updated.

   TYPE changed to use unsigned count.  SPACES count remains signed for
   backward compatibility but see glossary on handling negative counts.

   Renamed USER# [UP] to U# [U] respectively in the assembler.

v4.30

   Removed immediate EXIT and renamed (EXIT) to EXIT.

v4.07

   -TRAILING ZCOUNT now use the SSEG segment.  See SSEG in the glossary
   for details.

v4.05

   EDIT can no longer be used to load the editor from disk.  You must use
   SED or TED for that.  Once the editor is loaded and saved as part of
   the system, EDIT can be added as a synonym.

v4.03

   ALLOT has been changed (for the better).  Unlike Forth-94 ALLOT only
   unsigned values may be used.  Applications which used negative values
   with ALLOT should be changed to use -ALLOT instead.  Programs which
   require Forth-94 behaviour can be accommodated with the following
   redefinition:

     : ALLOT ( n -- )  NEGATE -ALLOT ;

   Note however that memory checking is not performed.

v4.02

   Functions '.' and '?' adopt the eForth behaviour i.e. when BASE is
   decimal display signed; otherwise display unsigned.  Only these
   functions and those which use them are affected.  Applications
   requiring Forth-94 behaviour may redefine:

     : . ( n -- )  S>D D. ;
