
                Text File Editor for DX-FORTH
                -----------------------------

TED is a resident text file editor.


1. INSTALLATION

DX-FORTH for CP/M must be configured for your terminal before
using the text file editor.  See DX-FORTH.TXT for further
details.

Users who prefer working with text files can replace the
resident screen file editor in DX-Forth with TED.  To do this
enter the following from the DOS command prompt:

     A:FORTH-F - SYSTEM INCLUDE TED AKA TED EDIT SAVE DX BYE


2. INVOKING

The text editor is invoked by typing TED.  If the editor is
not resident it is automatically loaded from disk file TED.F

If you mainly use text files you may want to add EDIT as a
synonym for TED as previously described.

     TED ( "filename[.F]" -- )

Load and edit the text file "filename".  If no filename is
given the file and line number as specified by LASTFILE and
LOADLINE are used.  In the case of an INCLUDE error, these
typically hold the filename and position where the error
occured.

Note: Specifying a filename with TED is only available once
TED has been loaded and the loader stub overwritten.

A "load/size error" is reported if the file cannot be found,
is write-protected or too large to fit in memory.

Edits are confined to memory and only written to disk on
exit with ^U (S)ave or when writing to another filename with
^Z (W)rite.

Lines can be up to 132 characters but only the leftmost are
displayed and directly editable.  Tabs are converted to
single spaces on loading.  Trailing blanks are automatically
removed as each line is edited.


3. STANDALONE EXECUTABLE

TED may be compiled as a standalone command-line executable.
To do this rename TED.F to TEDS.F and change the line:

        0 \ true for turnkey
to
        1 \ true for turnkey

Then compile using:

	FORTH - INCLUDE TEDS BYE

The standalone version includes a help screen and takes an
optional filename from the command-line as the input file.
