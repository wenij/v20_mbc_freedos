SERIAL.SCR   contains general purpose queue routines, plus        serial input and output routines.  The serial buffer is kept    within the dictionary.  Uses either multi-tasking serial port   polling or interrupts.                                                                                                        copyright 1989-2007 Frank C.

These words do not         themselves read the MSR as that would allow only a single test  of the delta bits because the process of reading the MSR would  clear the bits.  The approach we use allows multiple tests, e.g.                                                                   MSR PC@ ( msr)  DUP dCTS ( msr f) SWAP dDSR  ( f f )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ( select a serial port and create the queue)                                                                                    COM  fetches the base I/O address from the BIOS data area,           and sets up the serial port variables.

Note, the length             must be a power of two, or the cheap mod mask trick             will not work.

Do we want to run all waiting tasks between each  serial port read or do we want to drain the serial port with    no intervening tasks if one or more characters are waiting?     We will start with the second choice and only PAUSE after       draining all waiting characters.  If this causes problems,      we may need to put a PAUSE every 4 or 8 or so serial characters.On a fast machine, I do not believe the serial port can         cause an overrun, but we will see.

CLEAR-IID,   while bit 0 of IIR is zero, take the most likely                steps to clear the pending interrupt flags.                     Note, this should not be necessary, since we                    do not enable any ints except for data received                 and reading the DATA port should clear all the                  interrupt flags associated with received data.                  However, others have warned that this step is                   needed because some of the other interrupt flags                still get set from time to time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 HANDLER,   This lays down the assembly code for the interrupt              handler.  It must not be done until after the                   PORT SIRQ# etc variables are set, e.g. with 2 COM,              as the macros need to know port and interrupt values.                                                                           It goes through a rather elaborate procedure to                 attempt to guarantee the irq line will never be                 stuck on.  See the Serial Port FAQ for the                      reasoning behind this.  Probably the handler does               not need to be this elaborate if only a single                  port is attached to the irq.
