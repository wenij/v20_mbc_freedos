This file is a good place to put the source code you write.     To get you started, block 2002 shows a sequence of commands     you could type from the keyboard to make the least significant  bit of port C be an output bit and then set the bit high and    then set it low.  It also defines the word FLASH1 which will    toggle an LED or logic probe attached to that output pin (ie.   pin 9 on the PLCC version of either the 'A1 or 'E1).  Since     FLASH1 runs on the PC, you may interrupt it by pressing the Esc key.                                                            Then, block 2003, shows more or less equivalent 68HC11 assembly language.  2003 LOAD assembles the word FLASH2, then typing     the word FLASH2 causes the machine code to be downloaded to the 'HC11 and executed.  It runs in an endless loop, so you'll need to reset the 'HC11 and run DL8 once again to regain control.
