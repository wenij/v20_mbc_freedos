MONITOR.TXT

     is a copy of my 3-Instruction Forth article that appeared in
     the 1991 FORML Conference Proceedings (published by the
     Forth Interest Group).

MOND0.SCR
MONA1.SCR
MONE1.SCR

     contain the source code for the 3-instruction Forth for
     3 variants of the Motorola 68HC11 microprocessor.  The minor
     differences relate to where the different versions of the
     microprocessor map their memory-mapped registers and to how
     they expect to receive their initial program load in the
     bootstrap mode.  The monitors included here take
     up even less space in the 'HC11's memory than the original
     version in the article.  (In specialized cases, I have
     reduced the size of the monitor even further -- down to
     only 32 bytes.)


DEMO.SCR

     contains a small demonstration of how the 3-instruction
     Forth might be used to control i/o lines.
