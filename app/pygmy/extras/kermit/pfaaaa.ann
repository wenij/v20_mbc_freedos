[ note April, 2007  I have corrected my email
  and web addresses above.  References below
  to www.eskimo.com are no longer valid.  See
  pygmy.utoh.org instead (the Kermit files are
  bundled with Pygmy version 1.7). ]


I have written a very simple implementation of the
Kermit protocol in Forth.  In particular, it runs under
my Pygmy Forth for DOS (available from my web site),
but probably could be adapted easily to other Forths.
As the code is broken up into very small subroutines,
it might even be of interest for comparison purposes
for other languages, providing you read Forth.

I have also written an article describing this code:
"A Simple Implementation of the Kermit Protocol in
Pygmy Forth" appeared in the May/June and July/Aug
1997 issues (Volume XIX, Numbers 1 and 2) of _Forth
Dimensions_, published by the Forth Interest Group
(http://www.forth.org/fig.html).

The file pfkerm.zip contains a copy of the article,
the source code (in both Forth block files and as a
text file listing), and some email correspondence
between Frank da Cruz and myself containing some
corrections to the article.  pfkerm.zip is available
separately at my website and is also included in
the file pygmy15.zip and also on the Kermit ftp site.

The plain text files (i.e. not containing the Forth block
files and not containing the 132-column side-by-side
listing of the source and shadow blocks) are available on
the Kermit ftp site.  Get the files beginning with a "pf"
prefix.

The source code is not Public Domain or Shareware, but
you may use it freely for any private or commercial
purpose provided you do so at your own risk.

This effort makes no attempt to tap the speed potential
of Kermit.  I wanted to build into my medical
accounting application the ability for my customers to
upload and download small files, to and from a
mainframe, for medical billing/insurance claims
purposes.  It is working very well for this purpose.
