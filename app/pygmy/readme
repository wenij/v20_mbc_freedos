This is the Pygmy Forth version 1.7 which may be used and distributed
freely.  See the license in license20040130.txt or at
http://pygmy.utoh.org/license.html.

It runs on the IBM PC and clones and emulators such as DOS, Microsoft
Windows, FreeDOS and the DOS emulator under Linux, etc.  It includes a
multi-tasker and the ability to call C library routines and vice
versa.

To use it, create a directory for it and unzip
PYGMY17.ZIP into that directory, e.g.

          C:
          CD \
          MD PYGMY
          CD PYGMY
          COPY A:\PYGMY.ZIP
          UNZIP PYGMY.ZIP

You can use any unzip program.  I use the InfoZIP unzip.

Then, read the manual, PYGMY.TXT.
