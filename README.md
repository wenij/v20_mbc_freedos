# v20_mbc_freedos
this project was to build the freedos for [V20_MBC](https://hackaday.io/project/170924-v20-mbc-a-v20-8088-8080-cpu-homebrew-computer).

you can also reference the [Z80_MBC](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Z80MBC2) facebook site.

Because V20_MBC board was not a full PC compitable hardware, the main target was to run freedos on it with VT100 terminal (Tera Term ).

it need work with my modify v20_mbc ios version and another little bios code modify from  [Sergey Kiselev](https://github.com/skiselev/micro_8088). 

But bios part are still under working.
